Attempting to predict the NCAA tournamet using a random forest model. It doesn't do a sim so it doesn't know who is playing who. The predictions are a mix of a random forest with a max depth of 5 and 250 trees. The stats used can be seen in the cleaing file, I'll list them here but just trying to get this up.
