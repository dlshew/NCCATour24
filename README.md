Attempting to predict the NCAA tournamet using a random forest model. One issue is it doesn't do a sim so it doesn't know who is playing who. The predictions are made using random forests with a max depth of 5 and 250 trees. The stats fed into the model are listed as :Seed, :RankAdjTempo, :RankOE, :RankAdjOE, :RankDE, :RankAdjDE, :RankAdjEM, :SizeRank, :ExpRank, :BenchRank, :WABRank, :OEFGRank, :DEFGRank, :OFTRRank, :DFTRRank, :OTORRank, :DTORRank, :ORBRank, :DRBRank, in the code. They come from KenPom and Bart Torvik. I ran a random forest for each teams national ranking in each stat and then the actual stats themselves and then averaged the probablites. The cross entopy/log loss from the rankings traing was: Championship .0896, Final Four .192, Elite Eight .327. For the stats models: Championship .116, Final Four .192, Elite Eight .396. 

The easiest way to view this is just by clicking the tournament probs csv files. I sorted it by probablity to make the final four (I left probablites in their decimal form if you want percentage just multiply by 100). Probablites are under Champ, FinalF, EliteE then those are just converted to decimal odds. I personally don't agree with some of its choices, particularly Tennessee and North Carolina being so low. That could be a model issue or a me issue. Personally I beleive any model that has 1 or 2 seeds with a 0 percent chance of winning is at least a little off but I've been wrong plenty in my life so its probably a little of both.
